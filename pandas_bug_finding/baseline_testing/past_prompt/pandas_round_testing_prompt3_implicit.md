def round(
        self, decimals: int | dict[IndexLabel, int] | Series = 0, *args, **kwargs
    ) -> DataFrame:
        """
        Round a DataFrame to a variable number of decimal places.

        Parameters
        ----------
        decimals : int, dict, Series
            Number of decimal places to round each column to. If an int is
            given, round each column to the same number of places.
            Otherwise dict and Series round to variable numbers of places.
            Column names should be in the keys if `decimals` is a
            dict-like, or in the index if `decimals` is a Series. Any
            columns not included in `decimals` will be left as is. Elements
            of `decimals` which are not columns of the input will be
            ignored.
        *args
            Additional keywords have no effect but might be accepted for
            compatibility with numpy.
        **kwargs
            Additional keywords have no effect but might be accepted for
            compatibility with numpy.

        Returns
        -------
        DataFrame
            A DataFrame with the affected columns rounded to the specified
            number of decimal places.

        See Also
        --------
        numpy.around : Round a numpy array to the given number of decimals.
        Series.round : Round a Series to the given number of decimals.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame([(.21, .32), (.01, .67), (.66, .03), (.21, .18)],
        ...                   columns=['dogs', 'cats'])
        >>> df
            dogs  cats
        0  0.21  0.32
        1  0.01  0.67
        2  0.66  0.03
        3  0.21  0.18

        By providing an integer each column is rounded to the same number
        of decimal places

        >>> df.round(1)
            dogs  cats
        0   0.2   0.3
        1   0.0   0.7
        2   0.7   0.0
        3   0.2   0.2

        With a dict, the number of places for specific columns can be
        specified with the column names as key and the number of decimal
        places as value

        >>> df.round({'dogs': 1, 'cats': 0})
            dogs  cats
        0   0.2   0.0
        1   0.0   1.0
        2   0.7   0.0
        3   0.2   0.0

        Using a Series, the number of places for specific columns can be
        specified with the column names as index and the number of
        decimal places as value

        >>> decimals = pd.Series([0, 1], index=['cats', 'dogs'])
        >>> df.round(decimals)
            dogs  cats
        0   0.2   0.0
        1   0.0   1.0
        2   0.7   0.0
        3   0.2   0.0

try to find bugs in pandas round function
utilize context7 mcp to search for pandas 2.2.3 to generate correct test cases

---
only to coverage the cases that is not showed in doctring, 
the goal is to test the unhidden expectation, that other similar library's round will have (ex. numpy), test on different data type with round to check if there are any unconsistency

write the test script in pandas_bug_finding/baseline_testing, and name it as pandas_round_testing_implicit_no_hypothesis.py
